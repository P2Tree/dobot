# dobot
a driver software with Dobot platform in linux pc environment~~and Logitech camera to catch boxes with computer vision.~~ï¼Œ and i'm very sorry for we realized a function of catch boxes but for some reason i don't show this code here. 
**Only two** of the branches can be referenced:
- *master* branch is a basic dobot control driver for moving.
- *ros-dev* branch is a ros version of dobot control.

Luckly, I can tell you if you want to find camera and catch motion, you can see my another repository: https://github.com/PWESiberiaBear/movingCatchRobot
